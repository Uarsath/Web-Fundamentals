        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a rather varied background in my expertise. I am a Biopsychologist by education 
            as I have degrees in both Psychology and Biology as well as an associates from 
            the Community College of the Air Force in scientific applications. I served in the 
            Air Force for 6 years before heading to the private sector. I have coding experience 
            from my own projects as well as professional projects from school and work. One day I 
            hope to get into the field of biorobotics!
        </p>
        <h3>Favorite Coding Project</h3>
        <p>My favorite coding project is a labor of love that I have been doing for over a decade 
            now. It involves a neat little program called maptools that I've utilized for my pathfinder
            roleplaying game. It is what originally got me into coding and has taught me javascript, html, 
            and css as I endeavored to do more with the program. The most important concept I learned from
            this program is how to think like a coder and how to think outside the box when coding 
            issues arise. </p>
